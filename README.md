# Overview   
This repository aims to implement a simple model for the intake of antibiotics.  
We are supposing antibiotic pills are injested at discrete intervals. After entering the stomach
it is then passed over to the bloodstream.   
Our objective is to construct a model providing us with the amount of antibiotics over time in the bloodstream.
